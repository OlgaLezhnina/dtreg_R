* This new release addresses the issue raised by the CRAN team - 

"Dear maintainer,
Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_dtreg.html>.
Please correct before 2024-12-06 to safely retain your package on CRAN" -

by updating schemata for unit tests.

* Two more changes, unrelated to this issue, are included: updated static files and allowing schemata with flexibly selected parts.
